****Executive Summary

This paper emphasizes the use of modeling techniques suitable for analyzing eCommerce data from India using the Amazon Sales Report of 2022, which dataset originally contained 128,975 observations and 24 variables ( index, Order ID , Date , Status  , Fulfilment,  Sales Channel, ship-service-level , Style , SKU, Category, Size, ASIN,  Courier Status, Qty, currency, Amount, ship-city, ship-state, ship-postal-code, ship-country, promotion-ids, B2B, fulfilled-by, and Unnamed:22) primarily consists of categorical variables (19). Initially, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset without transformation. Subsequently, we applied EDA to the dataset after performing dummy variable transformations. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is titled 'Amazon Sales Report' and pertains to online sales from India. The primary objective of this study is to recommend the most suitable modeling technique for such data. Specifically, we aim to compare four models: Multi linear Regression,  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models . In the multi linear regression model, 'Amount' serves as the dependent variable, predicted by variables such as Index, Status, Fulfilment, Category,  Size, Qty, and ship-postal-code. Conversely, in the logistic regression , random forest, and decision tree models, the binary dependent variable 'Fulfilment' is predicted by  Index, Status, Category,  Size, Qty, Amount, and ship-postal-code.
